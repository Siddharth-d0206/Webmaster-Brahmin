<h1>$Cost Information$</h1>
<p>With a change in energy consumption, it comes with a cost. Here we outline the money it may cost you to make the worthwhile switch to green energy.</p>
<br>
<h3>Solar Panels</h3>
<li>
    <p>The average solar panel installation cost in the USA is anywhere from $15,000-$24,000.</p>
    <p>The per watt cost for energy produced by solar panels is generally $2.40-$3.60.</p>
</li>
<br>
<h3>Wind Turbine:</h3>
<li>
    <p>Cost of installation is anywhere from $10,000-$75,000 for residential turbines.</p>
<p>Maintaince costs $200-$300 per year</p>
</li>
<br>
<h3>Geothermal Energy:</h3>
<li>
<p>Most geothermal energy products used at home are heat pumps</p>
<p>Heat Pumps costs about $8,000-$24,000 to install(https://dandelionenergy.com/geothermal-operating-costs)</p>
<p>Cost is about $0.20 BTUH (British Thermal Units Per Hour)(https://dandelionenergy.com/geothermal-operating-costs)</p>
<p>Costs about $1,850 a year to operate(https://dandelionenergy.com/geothermal-operating-costs)</p>
</li>
<h3>Hydropower:</h3>
<li>
<p>Hydropower dams are more used on the commerical scale.</p>
<p>These dams cost about $1800 million to build a large scale dam(Science Direct)</p>
<p>Hydropower is produced for about $0.85 per kilowatt(https://www.wvic.com/Content/Facts_About_Hydropower.cfm)</p>
<p>Cost is 40% less than fossil fuels(https://www.wvic.com/Content/Facts_About_Hydropower.cfm)</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<br>
<h3>Biomass Energy</h3>
<p>Woodchips costs $20 FOB mill for 85 chips(hullforest)</p>
<p>Small scale plants cost 3,000-$4,000 to install (https://www.wbdg.org/resources/biomass-electricity-generation)</p>
<p>Cost to use energy is $0.08-$0.15 per kwh</p>
<p>Installation cost of an at home unit could go up to $13,000 (vtfarmtoplate)</p>
</li>
<br>
<h3>Tax Benefits</h3>
<li>
<p>Homeowners can get a tax right off of up to $1,200 per year for switching to renewable energy!(IRS)</p>
